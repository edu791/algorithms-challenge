Write a function `canSum(targetSum, numbers)` that takes in an array of numbers as arguments. 

The function should return a boolean indicating whether or not it is possible to generate the targetSum using the numbers from the array.

You may need an element of the array as many times as needed.

You may assume that all input numbers are nonnegative.
